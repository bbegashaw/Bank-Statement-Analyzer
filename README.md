# Bank-Statement-Analyzer
I built a Bank Statement Analyzing application in Java


It allows user to choose whichever csv file they would want to analyze and can get extra informatation out of such as total spending within a month or year or within a category. Includes a menu interface to make it easier to interact with the application.
